# lengthOfLargestSubString v2.0

lengthOfLargestSubString() is a JavaScript function to find the longest substring in a given string which does not contain repeats. This solution is superior to our previous (located in repo lengthOfLongestSubstring-v1.0), as it solves greater than 100% of LC test cases, including some in which the previous method failed.

# Example 1:

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

# Example 2:

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

# Example 3:

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
